# Chess game built with React & Redux 

This is a fully functional chess game for two players ~ or one person playing themselves. The game does not allow for *special* moves such as castling, pawn promotion, and en passant. I may add logic for this in future updates.
This game includes move validation, turn-based logic, and possible move highlighting.

## 🎯 Purpose
This game was created for practice purposes. It only has React and Redux related packages installed.

## Usage
